# Hangman


## Name: Hangman

## Description:
The Hangman game is a proactive game that prompts the user to guess the right word that the computer randomly generates. By using html, css, bootstrap, and mostly javascript, we were able to generate a fully functioning game. This project gave us the opportunity to use all the knowledge we have learned in the bootcamp so far, and apply it in order to make the game work.



## Usage:
This project can be used for fun. The theme of the hangman was major cities around the world. Although only 5 cities were utilized total in the game, it provides a template for further projects to possibly add more cities or to use different themes
